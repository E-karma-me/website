                    <p class="AP1">
                    E-karma is a revolutionary initiative aimed at revolutionising the way we handle electronic waste (e-waste). With the increasing concern for environmental sustainability and the proliferation of electronic devices, E-karma provides a convenient solution for users to responsibly dispose of their e-waste while also being rewarded for their efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "AP2">
                    The app works on a simple yet effective model: users schedule pickups for their e-waste through the E-karma platform. Our team then collects the e-waste and delivers it to partnering electronic recycling companies. In return for their contribution, users receive discount coupons and vouchers from these companies, directly proportional to the amount of e-waste they have recycled. This not only incentivises users to participate actively in e-waste management but also promotes a circular economy by encouraging the reuse and recycling of electronic materials.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "AP3">
                    E-karma is more than just a service; it's a movement towards a greener, more sustainable future. By harnessing the power of technology and collaboration, we aim to make a significant impact on reducing e-waste while simultaneously rewarding environmentally conscious behaviour. Join us in our mission to make every contribution count towards a cleaner planet with E-karma!
